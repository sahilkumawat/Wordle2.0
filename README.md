# Project 2 - *Wordle 2.0*

Submitted by: **Sahil Kumawat**

**Wordle 2.0** is an app that allows users to play an enhanced version of the classic word-guessing game Wordle, with additional features and customization options.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

## Notes

 Implementing the ability for the user to change the number of letters per row and the number of rows on the board while ensuring that the UI remains intuitive and responsive was challenging. I had to dynamically adjust the layout of the game board based on these settings.
