# *Wordle 2.0*

**Sahil Kumawat**

**Wordle 2.0** is an app that allows users to play an enhanced version of the classic word-guessing game Wordle, with additional features and customization options.

## Features

The following functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess

## Notes

 Implementing the ability for the user to change the number of letters per row and the number of rows on the board while ensuring that the UI remains intuitive and responsive was challenging. I had to dynamically adjust the layout of the game board based on these settings.
